                <h3>Consumers are returning to stores, boosting revenues after a slow start to the year.</h3>

                <p>Global retail sales have shown a strong rebound in the fourth quarter of 2025, signaling a recovery from the slower growth seen earlier in the year. According to data released by the International Retail Federation (IRF), worldwide retail revenues grew 5.6% compared to Q3, with particularly strong performance in electronics and home goods. Experts attribute the recovery to increased consumer confidence and seasonal holiday spending. “Shoppers are gradually returning to physical stores, but online sales continue to play a critical role,” said Maria Torres, senior analyst at MarketWatch Insights. Retailers are also investing in customer experience enhancements, such as AI-driven recommendation systems and contactless payment options, to maintain momentum into 2026. Analysts predict that this trend could lead to further growth of up to 6% in early 2026, particularly in markets that were hardest hit by inflation earlier in the year.</p>
